L 156 Apriori (py and R) and Eclat (R only)

Apriori:  people buy diapers and beers -- are these related?

three parts: support, confidence and lift

	support(X) = # of subjects who X / total # of subjects
		ex, # of people who saw Movie M2 are 10 / 100 = 10% support
		
	confidence(X1 -> X2) = # of people who X1 and X2 / # of people who X1
		ex, # of people who saw Movie M1 are 40 /100
		and # of people who saw both M1 and M2 are 7/ 40 (out of original 100)
		then confidence = 7/40 = 17.5%
		
	lift = confidence / support
		= 17.5 / 10 = 1.75
		
algorithm
	1. set up minimum support and confidence
	2. take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support
	3. take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confidence
	4. sort the rules by decreasing lift (greater lift = greater correlation b/t 1 and 2 (3 etc.))
	
	very slow, does multidimensional analysis ... so need limits

L158 R first

	creates a "sparse matrix" -- matrix with many 0s
	one column per produce
	"density" in summary = % of nonzero matrix entries
	
159 -- there is no general rule on what support/confidence values to use (varies by problem)
160 -- visualizing

161 et seq Python
	--apyori file is from Python Software Foundation -- read it?
		
// overly high confidence will give false correlations based on, e.g., best sellers
//  e.g., hot season --- buy a lot of water
// 	and most popular food = eggs --> false correlation b/t water and eggs

L 164 Eclat
	like a simplified apriori
	
	steps
		1. set a minimum support	
		2.  take all subsets in transactions > minimum support
		3. sort by decreasing support
		
//there is python eclat script(s) out there
