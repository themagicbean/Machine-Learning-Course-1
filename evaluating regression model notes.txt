evaluating regression modles notes

L 77 R squared intuition

SSres = SUM (yiactual - yipred)^2
(SSres = sum of squares of residuals)

SStot SUM(yiactual - yavg)^2
(total sum of squares)
(this is technically a regression, just an average of all)

R^2 = 1 - (SSres / SStot)
how much better fit is our reg (SSres) than the avg line (SStot)?
as line is better, SSres approaches 0 R^2 approaches 1
so higher (closer to 1) R^2 is better

R^2 can be negative if SSres is > SStot = terribly bad model :(

L 78 adjusted R^2 intuition
adding variables will never decrease R^2 (can increase or stay the same)

ADj R^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) * {(n-1)/(n-p-1)}
p = number of regressors
n = sample size
{} = penalization factor
as p incrases, ratio increases, so term after 1st - increases
so Adj R^2 val decreases (moves further from 1)
so since adding new var increases p and R^2, adj R^2 will be affected more clearly
	if variable does not help, increase in penalization factor reduces adj R^2
	if variable does help, change in R^2 overwhelms penalization factor

L 79 Evaluating regression models -- homework

homework: back to startups problem, reconsider if need to remove .06 p-val facctor (marketing spend)

OLS method never allows R^2 to decrease, but can use Adj R^2

note that adj R^2 actually decreased when removed marketing spend ...

L 80 Interpreting Coefficients

(using homeowrk / startup modle with BOTH RD & marketing

Coefficients:
		Estimate:  
			sign: if is positive, correlation b/t ind and dep var
			magnitude: be careful, very scale sensitive.  if 7.9e-01 and RD and profit in $, 1$ up RD -> .79cents
